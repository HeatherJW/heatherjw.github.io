                <h2>At work</h2>
                  <p>When I started working at Siyavula as a technical content editor I needed to learn coding to be able to create interactive maths and science questions. The chosen language was Python and so I read some books, played around a bit and started coding. I also helped edit and finalize the creation of several textbooks in pdf, epub and HTML format. From this role it was a natural step for me to move more into the development side and learn about websites and databases and such things. In the 3 years since starting my journey as a dev I have been expanding my skill set into full stack and backend development. I currently work with Pyramid and so my coding experience is largely in Python. Although my degree is in chemistry I have taken several courses online to learn more about programming in general and web development specifically.</p>
                  <p>I am passionate about testing. I love seeing well written tests and figuring out how to ensure new code is sufficiently tested. I am part of the Cape Town Testing MeetUp group and actively participate in the quarterly meetings.</p>
                  <p>I am particularly passionate about changing people's lives through any means. Education is a key means of helping people move to greater things in life. I enjoy working on projects that help people improve their lives.</p>
                  <p>Online courses have been my main way of gaining the skills I need and they are useful to return to for refreshers. These courses include a Udacity nanodegree in full stack web development and a series of courses in programming languages from Coursera.</p>
                  <p>My day to day work is very challenging and varied since I am part of a very small dev team. Since the team is small I have to be able to handle a variety of tasks including: updating and modifying the database; creating new web pages (both the backend and ensuring the page looks good); updating existing content; reviewing code; writing tests and fixing bugs.</p>
                <h2>At play</h2>
                  <p>Outside of work I mostly end up relaxing by hiking, reading or baking but occasionally I will tackle any problems that fascinate me such as determining which years we get the most long weekends to writing a script to help me decide what to make for dinner.</p>
                  <p>I belong to a hiking club to get out on the mountain with a great group of people. I also belong to two different bookclubs, each with a unique focus.</p>

              <h2>Current</h2>
                <h3>Python developer at Siyavula Education</h3>
                <p>As a python developer I work on the main <a href="siyavula.com">Siyavula website</a> developing new features for the site and maintaining the code.</p>
                <p>I work with the Pyramid framework, WTForms and Postgres (SQL) to build out the content on the site. On the testing side I use Python nose as the test runner and help ensure that tests are well written and comprehensive.</p>
                <p>In addition my duties include maintaining the main staging server for testing our features and deploying code to the live site.</p>
                <p>I assisted in converting the site from Plone to Pyramid and now we run fully on Pyramid. Due to the small dev team size I have worked on both front and back end tasks even though my focus has been mainly backend. I am comfortable with JavaScript, HTML, CSS and Sass as well as a little bit of React. One of the big tasks has been adding tests to the site.</p>
